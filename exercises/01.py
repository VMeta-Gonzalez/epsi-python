Declare the variable "school" which should contain the string EPSI
Declare the variable "year" which should contain the number 2020
Declare the variable "engineer" which should contain the boolean True
Declare the variable "cities" which should contain a list containing the following strings: Paris, Toulouse, Bordeaux

school = 
year = 
engineer = 
cities = 

print(school)
print(year)
print(engineer)
print(cities)
